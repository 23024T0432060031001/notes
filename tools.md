  * an app showing 3D rendering of mountains around
  * the rendering is much better than Google Street view
    + too smoothed to show distinctive rock features
  * originally developed to help mountaineers and hikers orientate, navigate and
    share geographic information on their smartphones
  * features
    + a 3D panorama allowing users to place themselves at any coordinates of
      their choice to scan a highly accurately rendered 360 degree landscape
    + a 2D contour map allows users to view the inclines of all natural slopes
      in a selected region, be that in a rural or urban environment
    + PhotoFit feature allows users to overlay the silhouettes of any skyline or
      natural landmark onto a photograph, allowing for comparison and therefore
      verification of the location of the image
      + photos can be uploaded and it can be overlaid onto the virtual view
    + its terrain shading and topology rendering algorithms make the valley
      floor’s raised road and grassy river basin distinct, and they adjust both
      seasonally and for time of day
      + it also provides a much more defined skyline
    + a dynamic location feature which re-renders the resulting image in almost
      real time as the user moves along the virtual landscape
    + by selecting distinct landmarks in PeakVisor’s 3D virtual panorama and
      measuring the distance from each to the presumed location
    + it displays the names of mountains in the panorama, stating their distance
      from the viewpoint in kilometres
  * Peakvisor OPen Source Investigation (POPSI) project is involved
