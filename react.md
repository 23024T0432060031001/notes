- use lower case in `from` clause of `import` statements
- use `className` in `jsx` in place of `class` in HTML markup
- in `return` clause of function `render()`, it is best to enclose it with
    parenthesis
- use `React.Fragment` element if a component needs to render more than one
  parent element
- No HTML comments in `jsx` and use curly brackets to enclose Javascript code
  and use block comments in Javascript code like `{ /* comment */ }`
