# Notes from HKOSCON 2023

- application and runtime in one binary and the binary runs on a hypervisor
- instead of a layered architecture, it composes of different components (os,
  libraries, application code) and makes into one layer
- targeting release of `1.0`  in 2024 Q1
- in theory, compiling a .NET application with a .NET runtime in a binary and
  loading the binary with ABI of Unikraft (Unikernel) should work
