- [Embedding models](https://ollama.com/blog/embedding-models)
  * embedding models, making it possible to build retrieval augmented generation
    (RAG) applications that combine text prompts with existing documents or
    other data
  * embedding models are models that are trained specifically to generate vector
    embeddings: long arrays of numbers that represent semantic meaning for
    a given sequence of text
    + the resulting vector embedding arrays can then be stored in a database,
      which will compare them as a way to search for data that is similar in
      meaning.
