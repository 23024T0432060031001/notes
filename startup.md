- Build a product in whatever way (even if it is quick and dirty) until it works
  and it has some users. With an early form of a product, it is easier to get
  feedback from users to improve, re-design and rebuild. The feedbacks can be
  used to learn, get ideas and validate the thinking.
- However, it is important to have a direction, goals and structure to build
  a product and not just to build whatever users want. Having a bigger picture
  of the product and dive into the reasons someone needs a feature, what it
  would enable them to do rather than build what they want.
- Having basic weekly/monthly/quarterly planning cycles reminds you and the team
  where you should be going.
