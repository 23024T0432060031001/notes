### Making comments

- it should not have comments that hurt others feelings
- try to remove emotions from comments and state facts and actions only
- respect the work done by reviewee (from the perspective of the reviewee, the
    work has been done, thus try to avoid saying it is not done)
- don't use judging words
- don't use good or bad, as the reviewee does not care about it instead only on
    whether his/her pull request can be merged or not
- ensure action driven feedback
- persist politely when necessary changes should be made (like no "refactor later")
