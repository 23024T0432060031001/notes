### 8-Point Grid System

The variety of screen sizes and pixel densities has continued to increase making
the work of asset generation more complicated for designers. Utilising an even
number like 8 to size and space elements makes scaling for a wide variety of
devices easy and consistent.

Scaling by increments of 8 offers a good amount of options without overloading
you with variables like a 6 point system, or limiting you like a 10 point
system.

For a team, it is an easy system of communication between designers and
developers (no fussing over pixels). A developer can easily eyeball an 8pt
increment instead of having to measure each time.

For users, it is a consistent aesthetic to the brand they trust. No blurry
half-pixel offsets on their preferred device.
