## 音読み and 訓読み (onyomi and kunyomi)

- 音読み (onyomi) - Chinese reading
- 訓読み (kunyomi) - Japanese reading
- Japan had their own language, and while it is not the same as Japanese today,
  it was not Chinese either
  * Japan had their own words for things like water, fire, food, and all the
    other stuff that exists in life.
  * instead of converting the Japanese language into Chinese, they decided each
    kanji will have a Chinese way of reading it and a Japanese way of reading it
  * the Chinese language has far more sounds than the Japanese language does
  * as well as Japan's lack of tones, this is the reason onyomi is similar to
    Chinese but not exactly the same as the originals
- in a dictionary, onyomi is written in katakana and kunyomi is written in
  hiragana
- there are also kanji characters that only have kunyomi readings because they
  are kanji created in Japan
  * 国字 (kokuji)
    + This means Japanese elite/scholars/priests took pieces of kanji characters
      and put them together to create a new kanji, for a concept that was native
      to Japan.
- multiple onyomi readings for a single kanji
  * imported from China at different times
  * usually similar meaning using the same reading (sound)
  * examples of 下
    + げ
      + 下品 (げひん)
    + か
      + 地下 (ちか)
  * imported from 3 major periods
    + 呉
    + 漢
    + 唐
- general rules
  * onyomi compounds
    + a two-kanji (or more) compound usually takes the onyomi readings
    + called jukugo 熟語 (じゅくご)
    + There are no hanging-on hiragana (okurigana) sticking out from the word
  * single kanji kunyomi
    + most words that consist of a single kanji, sitting all alone with no
      okurigana, are read with the kunyomi reading
  * single kanji onyomi
    + this is especially true for kanji numbers
  * kunyomi with okurigana
    + if a kanji has hiragana attached to it, it almost always uses the kunyomi
      reading
      + the kana suffixes are called okurigana 送り仮名 (おくがな)
  * exceptions
    + words that contain kanji that have both on'yomi and kunyomi readings
    + kanji that get assigned to katakana words
- strategy to learn
  * just learn one reading per kanji
  * choose the "best" kanji reading to learn
  * learn other readings through vocabulary
