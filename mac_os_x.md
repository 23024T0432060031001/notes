##### Creating installation media
```sh
sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia –volume /Volumes/Name –applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app –nointeraction
```
In case the machine shows `No bootable device`, try to clean the BIOS (NVRAM) by holding keys `cmd` + `alt` + `P` + `R`. See [How to Reset NVRAM on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-hk/HT204063) for more information.
