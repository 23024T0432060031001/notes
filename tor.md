## Concepts

- [3 types of relay](https://community.torproject.org/relay/types-of-relays/)
  - guard
    - encrypt traffic from clients or bridges and relay to middle relays
  - middle
  - exit
    - sends traffic out to destination
- [bridge](https://community.torproject.org/relay/types-of-relays/#bridge)
  - it is needed as there are censorships blocking IP address of public Tor
    relays and, even for private (hidden) Tor relays, censorships can
    identify the traffic by using deep packet inspection and eventually blocking
    the traffic to the relay (see
    [reference](https://www.technologyreview.com/2012/04/04/186902/how-china-blocks-the-tor-anonymity-network/)).
    Thus, a private bridge and obfuscation are needed to ensure traffic and IP
    address of both bridge and relay associated will be much harder to be
    identified.

  - [find a bridge and use a bridge](https://bridges.torproject.org/)
  - [manual](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/bridges/)
  - [moat](https://support.torproject.org/glossary/moat/) - an interactive tool
    you can use to get bridges from within Tor Browser. It uses domain fronting
    to help you circumvent censorship. Moat also employs a Captcha to prevent
    a censor from quickly blocking all of the bridges
- [WebTunnel Bridge](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/webtunnel/)
  * pluggable transport designed to mimic encrypted web traffic (HTTPS)
  * by wrapping the payload connection into a WebSocket-like HTTPS connection,
    appearing to network observers as an ordinary HTTPS (WebSocket) connection
  * allows a standard traffic reverse proxy to forward both ordinary web traffic
    and WebTunnel to their respective application servers
  * it can be used as an alternative to obfs4
  * Consider a network traffic censorship mechanism as a coin sorting machine,
    with coins representing the flowing traffic. Traditionally, such a machine
    checks if the coin fits a known shape and allows it to pass if it does or
    discards it if it does not. In the case of fully encrypted, unknown traffic,
    which doesn't conform to any specific shape, it would be subject to
    censorship. In our coin analogy, not only must the coin not fit the shape of
    any known blocked protocol, it also needs to fit a recognized allowed
    shape;otherwise, it would be dropped. Obfs4 traffic, being neither a match
    for any known allowed protocol nor a text protocol, would be rejected. In
    contrast, WebTunnel traffic resembling HTTPS traffic, a permitted protocol,
    will pass.
  * deployment involves configuring both a web server and a Tor bridge with this
    pluggable transport
    + when clients connect to the web server, they will be redirected to the
      WebTunnel proxy when they use a secret path
    + the secret path can be generated by `echo $(cat /dev/urandom | tr -cd
      "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmMNBVCXZLKJHGFDSAQWERTUIOP0987654321"|head -c 24)`

  - covering non-browser traffic on Android
- [Snowflake](https://snowflake.torproject.org/)
  - acts as a proxy relaying traffic to a bridge
