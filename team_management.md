- Coding
  - pairing less experienced engineers with the more experienced ones
  - supportive code reviews
    - not just offline ones, but talking code over
  - mob programming exercises
    - the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same
      space, and at the same computer. This is similar to pair programming.
- Engineering Practices
  - discuss what "quality" means in the team, and document them
  - define definition of done on a feature
    - discuss, document, follow.
- Training
  - complete relevant courses on technology used
    - summarise learnings
  - book club on a specific topic
- Getting things done
  - expose them to the business
    - product manager / designer / data scientist collaboration directly with
      people
    - share business goals, updates
    - team and org-wide demos
  - start small
    - give smaller, better defined tasks to them. this might mean cutting scope,
      and doing more pre-work (for you, the manager, and the PM)
  - mistakes, outages, bugs
    - expect them, and embrace them
    - do not create a culture of fear
- Expectations
  - career ladder: define what their level looks like, and what the next level
    is
  - competencies: define the dimensions on which they are evaluated (such as
    coding, architecture, execution, etc)
  - current situation: figure out (with them) where they are. Make a plan to
    close the most pressing gaps
- The hands-on manager
  - review their code, and work and give supportive feedback
  - where do they need the support to grow? can you help?
    - with direct feedback
    - with mentoring yourself
    - with connecting them with mentors
    - with pairing (and letting them drive)
- Be realistic
  - it will take time to grow
  - progress will be slower
  - set expectation upwards, and hold your back to your team
  - can you bring in seniors externally (such as contractors) for the sake of
    monitoring?
  - do celebrate progress and wins. one step at a time
