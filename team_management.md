### Managing a junior team

- Coding
  - pairing less experienced engineers with the more experienced ones
  - supportive code reviews
    - not just offline ones, but talking code over
  - mob programming exercises
    - the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same
      space, and at the same computer. This is similar to pair programming.
- Engineering Practices
  - discuss what "quality" means in the team, and document them
  - define definition of done on a feature
    - discuss, document, follow.
- Training
  - complete relevant courses on technology used
    - summarise learnings
  - book club on a specific topic
- Getting things done
  - expose them to the business
    - product manager / designer / data scientist collaboration directly with
      people
    - share business goals, updates
    - team and org-wide demos
  - start small
    - give smaller, better defined tasks to them. this might mean cutting scope,
      and doing more pre-work (for you, the manager, and the PM)
  - mistakes, outages, bugs
    - expect them, and embrace them
    - do not create a culture of fear
- Expectations
  - career ladder: define what their level looks like, and what the next level
    is
  - competencies: define the dimensions on which they are evaluated (such as
    coding, architecture, execution, etc)
  - current situation: figure out (with them) where they are. Make a plan to
    close the most pressing gaps
- The hands-on manager
  - review their code, and work and give supportive feedback
  - where do they need the support to grow? can you help?
    - with direct feedback
    - with mentoring yourself
    - with connecting them with mentors
    - with pairing (and letting them drive)
- Be realistic
  - it will take time to grow
  - progress will be slower
  - set expectation upwards, and hold your back to your team
  - can you bring in seniors externally (such as contractors) for the sake of
    monitoring?
  - do celebrate progress and wins. one step at a time

### Leading engineering teams

Reference: [An engineering leader's journey
](https://icecrime.net/life/technology/an-engineering-leader-journey/) by Arnaud

- common bottlenecks
  - insufficient clarity on strategy causing a lack of alignment toward
    priorities
  - excessive work in progress
  - a difficulty to move away from highly coupled historical systems all while
    keeping the business going
- ![heatmap of activity of teams in relation to business
  outcomes](https://icecrime.net/images/2020-10-19-an-engineering-leader-journey/heatmap.jpg)
- conclusions
  - Top-down initiatives are expected but having the majority of your product
    teams’ effort allocated to them is not a good sign: it begs the question of
    individual teams empowerment and the true autonomy of Product Managers.
  - The more initiatives a given team is contributing to, the more likely it
    will fail delivering on some combination of them. One can argue that a high
    number of small-ish things is fine, but experience shows it rarely is:
    context switching has a cost, and the likelihood of one of these small-ish
    things to reveal itself as a Pandora’s Box cannot be ignored.
  - For a given initiative, the number of impacted teams is of interest, if only
    as a proxy of the amount of coordination it will require, but more important
    is the existing contention of teams on its path. It sometimes takes a single
    team’s miss for an entire initiative to fail, and that risk grows as teams
    are spread thinner.
  - It’s a good model for examining roughly the “compatibility” of an initiative
    to be potentially started with the existing workloads on the team, or the
    inverse results of stopping one.
  - It’s a good model to support discussions of technical coupling and the value
    or architectural work (which could be the topic of an entire blog post
    itself) as it makes interdependencies more apparent.

### Company culture

agent](https://cutle.fish/blog/the-patient-change-agent)

##### Find out the problem

Observe for three months and try to answer the following questions.

- What forces are holding the problem in place?
- Who benefits from the status quo? Who will benefit from resolving the issue?
- Why wasn’t the org able to fix this?
- Does someone’s job involving fixing this? What is stopping them? Are they
  trying? Does someone’s job exist because this isn’t fixed?
- Are there benefits that I’m not seeing?
- How does change actually happen here?
- Has anything “worked”? Is there any momentum in terms of fixing the issue?
- Who has “skin in the game” vs. a secondhand interest in seeking improvement?
- Will anyone lose their job if the problem persists? Why?
- How is the status quo meeting people’s needs? Is there some shared vision of
  the future that might also meet people’s needs? Journaling helps you stay
  objective, and also gives you an outlet .

##### Run experiments

- The emphasis of an experiment is not on ensuring success or avoiding failure,
  but in allowing ideas that are not useful to fail in small, contained and
  tolerable ways
- Observable and time-bound. You’ll get data relatively quickly
- Involve invitation, not imposition
- Above all, the key thing here is to make them safe to fail. At no point should
  you put your job/career/well-being/sanity/relationships/enthusiasm in
  jeopardy. Never. It’s not worth it

##### Successful changes

- People will invite you to meetings to talk about it, and learn more about it
- Other parts of the organization will adopt it
- You’ll have volunteers to help you grow the idea
- Someone will try to take credit for it (a good sign)
- People will reach out to thank you
- It will grow organically and virally. You will sense the momentum and
  excitement. It will be palpable. No momentum... then it isn’t working.

##### Take stock

- Set a concrete stay/leave goal…if your “score” remains undecided (or less) for
  an extended period of time (e.g three months), consider leaving at your twelve
  month mark
