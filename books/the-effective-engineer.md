### Chapter 1 Focus on High-Leverage Activities

- Two highest leverage investment
  - onboard program
    - tech talks
    - code labs
      - going through design documents
      - teaching development tools and debugging tools
  - mentoring program
    - code review
    - outlining technical skills to learn
    - pair programming
    - discussing engineering trade-offs
    - explaining how to prioritise better
    - offering guidance on how to work well with different team members
    - plan a sequence of starter tasks and projects to increase the new hires’
      mastery of systems
- Leverage = Impact / Time invested
  - Time is the most limited resource
- Meeting leverages
  - preparing an agenda and a set of goals for the meeting and circulating them
    to attendees beforehand so that the meeting is focused and more productive
  - if an in-person discussion is not actually necessary, replacing the meeting
    with an email discussion and spending the time building an important feature
- Development leverages
  - automating parts of the development or testing process that have thus far
    been done manually, so that you can iterate more quickly
  - talking with the customer support team to gain insights into the customers’
    biggest pain points, and using that knowledge to understand whether there
    are other features you could be working on that would produce even more
    value with less development effort
- Performance enhancement leverages
  - learning to effectively use a profiling tool so that you can reduce the time
    it takes to identify each bottleneck
  - measuring both the performance and visit frequency of each web page so that
    you can address the bottlenecks that affect the most traffic first, thereby
    increasing the impact of each fix you make
- Making hiring is a high leverage task
  - engineers should not skip interviews to do other work
  - the best would be to submit feedback immediately
  - allocate the best time-slot when recruiters needed to schedule interviews
    with candidates


### Chapter 2 Optimise for learning

- Applying for a job
  - Fast growth
    - At fast-growing teams and companies, the number of problems to solve
      exceeds available resources, providing ample opportunities to make a big
      impact and to increase your responsibilities
    - Easier to attract strong talent and build a strong team
  - Training
    - Strong on-boarding programs demonstrate that the organization prioritises
      training new employees
  - Openness
    - Openness to incorporate feedback into the future iterations
      - Examples
        - Conduct post-mortems after outages
        - Document insider-knowledge
        - One team knows what the other team does
  - Pace
    - Fast iterations
    - Automation tools
    - Lightweight approval processes
    - A willingness to experiment accelerate progress
      - Examples
        - Check the percentage of time spent on maintenance versus developing
          new products and features
  - People
    - Smarter people around means surrounding yourself with potential teachers
      and mentors
  - Autonomy
    - The freedom to choose what to work on and how to do it drives our ability
      to learn
    - The freedom to change teams
- Examples on 20% time
  - Develop a deeper understanding of areas you are already working on and tools
    that you already use
  - Adjacent disciplines
    - Product engineer
      - Product management
      - User research
      - Backend engineering
    - Infrastructure engineer
      - Machine learning
      - Database internals
      - Web development
    - Growth engineer
      - Data science
      - marketing
      - Behavioural psychology
- Suggestions on 20% time
  - Study code for core abstractions written by the best engineers at your
    company
  - Write more code
  - Go through any technical, educational material available internally
  - Master the programming languages that you use
  - Send your code reviews to the harshest critics
  - Enroll in classes on areas where you want to improve
  - Participate in design discussion of projects you are interested in
  - Work on a diversity of projects
  - Make sure you are on a team with at least few senior engineers whom you can
    learn from
  - Jump fearlessly into code you don’t know
- Always learning
  - Learn new programming languages and frameworks
  - Invest in skills that are in high demand
  - Read books
  - Join a discussion group
  - Attend talks, conferences and meet-ups
  - Build and maintain a strong network of relationships
  - Follow bloggers who teach
  - Write to teach

### Chapter 3 Prioritise Regularly

- Prioritisation
  - hard work
  - Requires practice
  - Misallocate time is okay, as long as there is retrospective, things will be
    improved
- Checklist
  - The first step in effective prioritisation is listing every task that you
    might need to do
    - Human brain is optimised for processing and not for storage
    - Brainpower is much better spent on prioritising our work and solving
      engineering problems than on remembering everything we need to do
  - Properties
    - A canonical representation of work (and a single list)
    - Easily accessible
- Tips on prioritisation
  - Compile a small number of goals that are important to complete, pick
    initial tasks toward those goals and then make a pairwise comparison between
    what you are currently doing and what else is on the to-do list
    - Reason
      - It is not actually useful to know that the 100th task provides higher
        leverage than 101st task
  - The goal is not to establish a total ordering of all your priorities
    - Any ordering made will be based on imperfect information
  - Iterate on the question
    - Is there something else I could be doing that is higher-leverage?
    - Continuously shift your top priorities toward the ones with the highest
      leverage, given the information available at the time
- Focuses
  - On what directly produces value
  - On the important and non-urgent
    - To priorities the investments that increase our ability to be more
      effective and deliver more value in the future
    - Examples
      - Planning career goals
      - Building stronger relationships
      - Reading books and articles for professional development
      - Adopting new productivity and efficiency habits
      - Building tools to improve our workflows
      - Investing in useful abstractions
      - Ensuring that infrastructure will continue to scale
      - Learning new programming languages
      - Speaking at conferences
      - Mentoring our teammates to help them be more productive
      - Prioritisation of tasks
    - If there is too much time spend on important and urgent activities
      (fire-fighting)
      - It is a sign that the root cause is underinvestment in important and
        non-urgent activities
        - Examples
          - Frequent pager duty alerts might indicate a need for automated
            recovery procedures
          - High-priority bugs might be a symptom of low test coverage
          - Constant deadlines might be caused by poor project estimation and
            planning
- Protecting schedule of maker (developer)
  - Not to be influenced too much by meeting schedule
  - Empirical research highlights the cost of breaking schedule of a maker
    (developer)
    - Typically from 10 to 23 minutes
  - Managers tend to schedule things into one-hour blocks
  - Makers (developers) tend to schedule things into a day or half a day
- Avoid multitasking
  - When we fragment our attention too much, we end up reducing our overall
    productivity and hindering our ability to make substantive progress on any
    one thing
  - When a team fragment their efforts across too many tasks, they stop sharing
    the same context for design discussions or code reviews. Completing
    priorities divide the team and, momentum on any one activity slows down
- Fight procrastination with if-then plans
  - Subconscious follow-up is important because procrastination primarily stems
    from a reluctance to expend the initial activation energy on a task
  - When we make if-then plans and decide what to do ahead of time, it is more
    likely to consider the long-term benefits associated with a task
- An example of to-do list
  - Sections
    - Current priorities
      - Doing
      - Today
      - This week
    - Backlog

### Chapter 4 Invest in iteration speed

- Continuous deployment
  - Elements
    - Tools to automate versioning and packaging
    - Testing framework that parallelised thousands of unit and integration
      tests across a tier of worker machines
    - Investing in dashboards and alerts that monitor health of products
    - Tools to easily roll back changes in the event that some bad code had
      fallen through the cracks
  - Reasons
    - Eliminated the manual overhead associated with each deployment
    - Giving high confidence that each deployment is just business as usual
- Invest in time-saving tools
  - Examples
    - Use a language that allows REPL (read-eval-print-loop)
    - Hot code reloads
    - Continuous integration
- Shortening the debugging and validation loops
  - Structuring (or architecting) the code properly with correct dependencies
    which is mockable
  - Find ways to shorten the loop every time a bug is found
- Mastering programming environment
  - Get proficient with a text editor or IDE
  - Learn at least one productive, high-level programming language
    - Like python or ruby but not C/C++
  - Get familiar with shell commands
    - Examples
      - `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `awk`, `sed`, `xargs`, `find`
  - Prefer the keyboard over the mouse
  - Automate manual workflow
    - Example
      - Shell scripts
      - Browser extension
      - Hot browser reload
  - Test out ideas on an interactive interpreter
  - Make it fast and easy to run just the unit tests associated with current
    changes
    - Integrate unit tests into text editor or IDE

### Chapter 5 Measure What You Want to Improve

- Metrics to measure
  - 95th or 99th percentile response times
    - Rather than average response times
  - Bugs outstanding
    - Rather than bugs fixed
  - Weekly growth rate of registered users
    - Rather than registered users
  - Weekly active rate by age of cohort
    - Rather than weekly active users
- Choosing a metric
  - Maximise impact
  - Actionable (can be explained by team’s effort)
  - Responsive (one can be quickly reflected)
- Measuring everything to understand what is going on
  - To keep the team on-track with short-term goals
- measure every metrics and present them onto a dashboard
- getting to know what the normal metrics are helps understanding abnormalities
  when there are exceptions
- adopting a mindset of instrumentation means ensuring the team have a set of
  dashboards that surface key health metrics and that enable a team member to
  drill down the relevant data
- tools
  - [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/)
  - [StatsD](https://github.com/statsd/statsd)
  - [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/)
  - [Ganglia](http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/)
  - [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/)
  - [munin](https://munin-monitoring.org/)
  - [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)
  - [AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/)
- successful technology companies build the equivalent of a pilot's flight
  instruments, making it easy for engineers to measure, monitor, and visualise
  system behaviour
- strategies on metric gathering
  - log data liberally, in case it turns out to be useful later on
  - build tools to iterate on data accuracy sooner (for example, tools to
    analyse logs)
  - write end-to-end integration tests to validate your entire analytics
    pipeline
  - examine collected data sooner
  - cross-validate data accuracy by computing the same metric in multiple ways
  - when a number does look off, dig in to it early

### Chapter 6 Validate Your Ideas Early and Often

- failing example of Cuil (a search engine)
  - Cuil had wanted to make a big splash at launch and feared leaking details to
    the press, they had not hired any alpha testers to play around with the
    product.
  - prior to launch, there was no external feedback to point out that the search
    quality was not there, that the search engine was not returning enough
    results, and that users did not care about the size of index if it did not
    actually lead to higher quality results
