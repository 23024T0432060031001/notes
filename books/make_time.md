- [Make Time - How to focus on what matters every day](https://maketime.blog/)
  by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky

## Highlight

- three ways to pick your highlight
  - urgency
    - if you have something that absolutely positively must be accomplished
      today, make it your highlight
      - look for projects that are time-sensitive, important and medium-size
  - satisfaction
    - instead of what needs to be done, it is more about what you want to get
      done
    - these items are super vulnerable to procrastination as they are important
      but not time-sensitive
      - make it a highlight to break the "someday" cycle
  - joy
    - it could be things not related to work at all
- trust your gut to choose the best highlight

### Choose your highlight

- write it down
  - either in the evening or morning
  - choices
    - calendar event
    - sticky notes
  - make it obvious to remind yourself during the day
- stack rank your life
  - make a list of priorities and circle the most important one
  - the circled one can be changed over time
- batch little stuff
  - do this once a week or so to clean-up noises and allows focus on other days
    - satisfaction comes with the completion of small tasks
- to-do list
  - disadvantages
    - it could be a list of others priorities not yours
    - it could make someone try to knock off the easier ones first
    - giving the feeling of "unfinishedness"
  - advantages
    - capture things so that you do not have to hold it in your brain
- might-do list
  - a list of things can be done with out ordering by priority
  - move the most important item (according to urgency, satisfaction and joy)
    and make it to Highlight
  - the process ensures things get done (made to highlight) involved
    a thoughtful decision instead of easiness
- burner list
  - steps
    - divide a paper into two columns
    - put the most important project and its to-do list on the left
    - put the second most important project and its to-do list of top half of
      the column on right-hand-side
    - put all other items/projects in bottom half of the column on
      right-hand-side
  - the to-do lists are not meant to be completed
  - the burner list is meant to be re-created every few days
- personal sprint
  - working on the same highlight for consecutive days
    - reducing context switches

### Make time for your highlight

- schedule the highlight into your calendar
  - schedule other items around the Highlight
- block your calendar
  - use "do not schedule" event
    - to prevent others schedule meetings at those times
    - might start with blocking one or two hours at first
- drop some less important items to make time for highlight in case of
  over-scheduling
- make detailed schedule of a day
  - the freedom comes from the fact that you will not need to think about what
    to do next but focus on how
  - it gives feedback of what works and what does not at the end of the day
  - it is particularly useful for people work from home
- quit when you're done
  - no working till exhaustion as it is robbing the rest required to prioritise
    and do our best work
  - avoid "just one more thing" and listen to the body

    read

      to bang out multipages manifesto when a simple reply would do

    - if their thing is really and truly urgent and important, they will track
      you down in person or on the phone
- reset expectations
  - either send a message to let others know, or
  - others will eventually learn that you are slow to respond and they will
    adapt
- setup send-only email
  - setup up SMTP but no IMAP
- vacation off the grid
- lock yourself out
  - use an app to cutoff internet most of the time except
    - the end of day in another timezone
    - the end of day in the local timezone

### Make TV a "sometimes treat"

- don't what the news
  - only once per day or once a week
- put your TV in the corner
- ditch your TV for a projector
- go a-la-carte instead of all-you-can-eat
  - un-subscribe once you are done with the program you want to watch
- if you love something, set it free
  - unplug the TV for a while and you may not miss it

### Find flow

- shut the door
  - a place you can camp out in for a few hours
  - wearing headphone
- invent a deadline
  - let others know you want to finish something so that they could give
    yourself pressure in finishing it
- explode your highlight
  - breaking down a highlight item into small tasks
    - best to start describing each task with a verb
- play a laser sound track
  - a playlist only played during times of concentration
- set a visible timer
  - to make time (remaining time) physically visible
- avoid the lure of fancy tools
  - like building a CLI tool for a task where it may not be used very frequently
- start on paper
  - paper improves focus
    - no time spent to mess with fonts, for example

### Stay in the zone

- make a random question list
  - state random thoughts /questions / researches in the list during focus mode
    and come back to that list afterwards
- notice one breath
  - breath exercise to reset attention back to the focus
- be bored
  - bored people gets more creative
- be stuck
  - stare at the blank seen, or switch to paper, or walk around, but keep your
    focus on the project at hand
    - even when your conscious mind feels frustrated, some quiet part of your
      brain is processing and making progress
- take a day off
- go all in
  - instead of taking a break, go all in with total focus

## Energise

- if you are energise, it is easier to maintain your focus

### Keep it moving

- exercise every day (but don't be a hero)
- pound the pavement
  - waking
    - improve your mood through the release of painkilling endorphins
    - make time to think/plan about highlights
    - replaces transportation or some part of it
- inconvenience yourself
  - cook dinner
  - take the stairs
  - use a suitcase without wheels
    - from time to time
- squeeze in a super short workout
  - yoga at workplace
  - intense intervals for short period of time of day

### Eat real food

- eat like a hunter-gatherer
  - eat and cook with simple recipes
  - avoid processed food
- central park your plate
  - put salad on the plate first
- stay hungry
  - fasting hungry at the beginning can be distracting
  - early dinner, skip breakfast and big lunch
    - 16-hours of fasting
- snack like a toddler
- go on the dark chocolate plan
  - dark chocolate has a less sugar rush
    - but beware of the caffeine with it

### Optimize caffeine

- wake up before you caffeinate
  - adenosine
    - tell the brain to slow down and feel sleepy or groggy
  - caffeine binds to the receptors where the adenosine is supposed to go
    - adenosine is left to just float around and the brain does not get the
      sleepy signal
  - if you drink a lot of caffeine, your body adjusts to more and more caffeine
    by producing more and more adenosine to compensate
  - conclusion is not to have coffee too soon after getting up
- caffeinate before you crash
  - too late if you feel tired
- take a caffeine nap
  - caffeine takes a while to work so sleep through it
- maintain altitude with green tea
  - to avoid high dose of caffeine with coffee
- turbo your highlight
- learn your last call
- disconnect sugar
  - sugar rush is not good for sustained energy

### Go off the grid

- get woodsy
  - even brief exposure to a forest lowers stress, heart rate, and blood
    pressure
- trick yourself into mediating
  - for human beings, thinking is the default position
  - constant thinking means your brain never gets rest
  - when you meditate, instead of passively going along with the thoughts, you
    stay quiet and notice the thoughts and slows them down and gives your brain
    a break
  - meditation is also exercise of brain
  - staying quiet and noticing your thoughts is refreshing but it is also hard
    work
- leave your headphones at home
  - try not to having it all the time of day
- take real breaks
  - take break without screens

### Make it personal

- spend time with your tribe
  - spend time in face-to-face meetups
- eat without screens

### Sleep in a cave

- make your bedroom a bed room
  - no screens
  - do readings (Kindle is okay)
  - keep the room dark
- fake the sunset
  - use smart lighting as an alarm
- sneak a nap
- don't jet-lag yourself
  - catching up by sleeping late on weekends does not work
    - it confuses your internal clock
- put on your own oxygen mask first
  - take care of yourself first then others
