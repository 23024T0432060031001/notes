# Scrum

### Product backlog

- no labels on items of product backlog (e.g. must-have, nice-to-have)
- each item must be complete in a sprint (it won't span more than one sprint)
- it is meant to be replacing PRD (product requirement document), or functional
  specification
  - probably requirements in PRD is too big to be implemented
- each item can be implemented and tested separately
- must be non-technical (like create a database table)
- an item should not include component work, things which are invisible to
  users, prototypes, hacks, ongoing or repeated work
- the ordered list of ideas for the product, kept in the order we expect to
  build them
- the single source from which all requirements flow
- each item contains a description and estimate
- items may originate from the product owner, team members or other
  stakeholders

### User story

- describe it from someone's perspective
- acceptance criteria can be added as the detailed requirement or scope of the
  implementation. it can also include performance requirements
- technical specification can be attached if required but it is not a must
- scrum does not use functional specification

### Backlog refinement

- it can be changed and refined at anytime except the moment before sprint
  planning
- an ongoing activity throughout the project
- includes estimating items
- an activity for all the team members

### Splitting a story

- for a bigger story, it can be split into smaller stories based on use cases

### Ordering

- items with higher risk should have a higher priority (so that we know earlier
  whether it would work or not)

### Product Owner

- one per team
- single point of communication with "outside"
- no place for product manager
- responsible for deciding what work will be done
- the person who is expected to do the best possible job of satisfying all the
  stakeholders
- manage product backlog

### Scrum

- concept of time-box (less chaos)
- potentially ship-able product after each sprint

### Delivery team

- development team
- scrum master
- product owner

### development team

- builds the product incrementally
- expected to be available to the project full time
- determine how much they can do in one sprint

### Scrum master

- process champion (decides how scrum process is implemented)
- obstacle remover
- change agent (educating outside the scrum team)
- servant leader (taking the shits, and/or suggesting new technologies or
  methodologies)
- servant leader
- helping the team and the organisation make the best use of Scrum
- works with
  - product owner
    - to help product owner understand how to create and maintain the product
      backlog
  - development team
    - to find and implement the technical practices that will allow them to
      get to done at the end of each sprint
  - whole scrum team
    - to evolve the definition of done
- remove teamâ€™s impediments
- protects the team from both internal and external distractions
- facilitate meetings
- helps keep the team on track, productive and growing in ability

### Scrum planning

- Daily
- Sprint
- Release
- Roadmap
- Vision

### Sprint planning

- big picture and rolling release planning (it could mean breaking down future
  stories which will not be worked on the current sprint)
- review product backlog
- select high priority product backlog items for the sprint
- discuss stories to create tasks
- estimate tasks
- decide how much work to commit
- at the beginning of each sprint
- the team collaborates to select and understand the work to be done in the
  upcoming sprint
- involves entire team
- reaches a common understanding of definition of done for each item
- parts
  - determine what work will be completed
    - product owner presents the items in backlog
    - development team to decide how many items to take
  - determine how the work will be accomplished
    - development team do sufficient design and planning to be confident of
      completing work during the sprint
    - mostly a development team process
- results a sprint backlog
  - the detailed plan for development in the next sprint

### Definition of done

- agreement between product owner and development team
- software (code completion, code review, unit tests)
- tests (functional tests, load tests, regression tests)
- documentation (user documentation, design documentation release notes, API
  documentation)

### Ideal hour

- the amount of work one can do in an un-interrupted hour

### During a sprint

- no addition of stories
- no changes of stories
- multiple development team members swarming a story
- estimates can be updated (increase/decrease)
- logging actual hours spent is not important
- additional tasks can be added if necessary

### Daily scrum/stand-up

- a self-organising behaviour
- what did you do yesterday?
- what are the blockers?
- what will you do today?
- not a status report
- not a report to anyone but a communication meeting within the team
- people outside the scrum team are welcome to listen but should not speak

### Burn down chart

- shows the updated remaining estimate on all the stories in the sprint

### Sprint review

- the "demo"
- accepting feedbacks from all the stakeholders
- an informal meeting
- everyone can have input during the meeting
- demo is common but not a must
- updates product backlog

### Sprint retrospective

- safety (make sure team members feel comfortable to say things, so product
  owner  is optional)
- list of goods and changes
- list of starts, stops and continues
- a timeline of the sprint and put stickers of goods and bads
- the process
- the relationships among people
- the tools

### Agile release planning

- product owner determines when to delivery
- all stakeholders and scrum team members should join

### Velocity history

- in terms of number of stories not the actual hours or estimated hours
- the catch is that the split stories are more or less of the same size

### Scrum might be unnecessary when

- project lifetime is very short
- not even a project
- team smaller than 5 or no stable teams

### Agile Manifesto and Scrum

- individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - scrum relies directly on trust in teams, the individuals in the teams and
    the way they interact
  - teams figure out what is to be done, teams figure out how to do it, and
    teams do it.
  - internal problems
    - team take the responsibility and to resolve all the difficulties
  - concerns outside the team
    - team works with other parts of the organisation
- working software over comprehensive documentation
  - product increment as the major result of every sprint
    - documentation can be done but it is not the primary result
    - a required result of every sprint
    - an integrated version of the product, kept at high enough quality to be
      - shippable if the product owner chooses to ship it
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - product owner is the prime point of contact with the eventual users
- responding to change over following a plan
  - everyone has the information they need to make good decisions about the
    project
  - the backlog of things to be done is available for all to see
  - problems and concerns are discussed openly and dealt with immediately

### Scrum Values

- focus
- courage
- openness
- commitment
- respect

### Scrum

- a framework for building a product
- a team process
- requires transparency within the team and with the stakeholders
  - produces visible displays of plans and progress
    - any extra artefacts could be created to increase transparency
      - example: burn charts, task boards
