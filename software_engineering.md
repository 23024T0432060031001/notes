- Run unit tests before pushing any commit to source control
- Run unit-tests on each merge and push
- Even a commit is meant to be deployed immediately, it is better to make the commit onto a branch before merging it into master branch
- Requirements should be documented either in product or sprint (or both) backlog
- To name something (e.g. a variable) in code, avoid copy and paste without generalising and thinking of naming convention
- Check if any files should not be committed before creating a git commit
- Don't put un-related changes in to the same commit
