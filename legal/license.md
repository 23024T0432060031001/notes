## Copyleft

- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft)
- it has a requirement of the same rights be preserved in derivative works
- it is considered protective or reciprocal in contrast with permissive free
  software licenses
- it helps ensuring everyone's rights to freely use the product but is
  prohibited from owning, registering copyright and earning royalties from
  copyright
- the distributed modified work must include a means of modifying the work
- under fair use, copyleft licenses may be superseded
  * any person utilizing a source licensed under a copyleft license for works
    they invent is free to choose any other license (or none at all) provided
    they meet the fair use standard
  * people contribute to work under this license deliberately give up some of
    the rights that normally follow from copyright, including the right to be
    the unique distributor of copies of the work
- in most European countries, it is not permitted for a software distributor to waive all warranties regarding a sold product.
  * warranties are specified in most European copyleft licenses
    + examples
      + European Union Public Licence (EUPL)
      + CeCILL license
        + allows one to use GNU GPL in combination with a limited warranty

## Advertising clause

- required authors of all deriving works to include an acknowledgment of the
  original source in all advertising material

# Licenses

## MIT

- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)
- identifier
  * `MIT`
- a permissive license
  * it puts very few restrictions on reuse and therefore has high license
    compatibility
- permits reuse within proprietary software
  * provided that all copies of the software or its substantial portions include
    a copy of the terms of the MIT License and also a copyright notice
- it is not a copyleft license
- it does not discuss patents
- it does not impacts derivative works
- users
  * X Window System
  * Node.js
  * Lua
  * jQuery
  * .NET
  * Angular
  * React

## BSD

- Berkeley Software Distribution
- requirements
  * all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code
    format, or
  * reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format
- it does not require that source code be distributed at all
- the original license has 4 clauses but the modified (modern) version has the
  advertising clause removed and has only 3 clauses
- FreeBSD License is a variant of BSD License in that it has one of the clauses
  related to restricting use of the names of contributors for endorsement of
  a derived work without specific permission

## Apache

- latest version of `2.0` should be used
- it improves compatibility with GPL-based software
  * version `2.0` is compatible with `GPLv3`
- reqiurements
  * application of the same license to all unmodified parts
  * in every licensed file, original copyright, patent, trademark, and
    attribution notices must be preserved
  * in every licensed file changed, a notification must be added stating that
    changes have been made to that file
  * If a `NOTICE` text file is included as part of the distribution of the
    original work, then derivative works must include a readable copy of these
    notices within a `NOTICE` text file distributed as part of the derivative
    works, within the source form or documentation, or within a display
    generated by the derivative works (wherever such third-party notices
    normally appear)
    + The contents of the `NOTICE` file do not modify the license, as they are
      for informational purposes only, and adding more attribution notices as
      addenda to the `NOTICE` text is permissible, provided that these notices
      cannot be understood as modifying the license. Modifications may have
      appropriate copyright notices, and may provide different license terms for
      the modifications.
- unless explicitly stated otherwise, any contributions submitted by a licensee
  to a licensor will be under the terms of the license without any terms and
  conditions, but this does not preclude any separate agreements with the
  licensor regarding these contributions
- the user is granted a patent license from each contributor to "make, have
  made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work."
  * if the user sues anyone alleging that the software or a contribution within
    it constitutes patent infringement, any such patent licenses for that work
    are terminated
- users
  * Android

## GPL

- GNU General Public License
- a copyleft license
- to keep the license up to date, the GPL license includes an optional "any
  later version" clause
- requirements
  * terms and conditions of the license must be made available to anybody
    receiving a copy of the work that has a GPL applied to it
  * a distributor may not impose "further restrictions on the rights granted by
    the GPL
    + this forbids activities such as distributing the software under
      a non-disclosure agreement or contract
  * programs distributed as pre-compiled binaries be accompanied by a copy of
    the source code, a written offer to distribute the source code via the same
    mechanism as the pre-compiled binary, or the written offer to obtain the
    source code that the user got when they received the pre-compiled binary
    under the GPL
- any licensee is given permission to modify the work, as well as to copy and
  redistribute the work or any derivative version
- licensee is allowed to charge a fee for this service or do this free of charge
- The FSF does not hold the copyright for a work released under the GPL unless
  an author explicitly assigns copyrights to the FSF
  * which seldom happens except for programs that are part of the GNU project
- in purely private (or internal) use—with no sales and no distribution—the
  software code may be modified and parts reused without requiring the source
  code to be released
- the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) was created to have a weaker
  copyleft than the GPL, in that it does not require custom-developed source
  code to be made available under the same license terms
- as of February 2024, usage of `GPLv2` is still higher than `GPLv3`
- users
  * Linux kernel (`GPLv2`)
  * GCC

## AGPL

- GNU Affero General Public License
- designed to close a perceived application service provider (ASP) loophole in
  the ordinary GPL
  * by using but not distributing the software, the copyleft provisions are not
    triggered
- based on `GPLv3`
- it is intended for software designed to be run over a network
  * adding a provision requiring that the corresponding source code of modified
    versions of the software be prominently offered to all users who interact
    with the software over a network
- compatibile with `GPLv3`
- users
  * Flask
  * MongoDB (previously)
  * RethinkDB
  * SugarCRM

## MPL

- Mozilla Public License
- a weak copyleft license
- it defines rights as passing from "contributors", who create or modify source
  code, through an optional auxiliary distributor (itself a licensee), to the
  licensee
  * it grants liberal copyright and patent licenses allowing for free use,
    modification, distribution, and "exploitation" of the work, but does not
    grant the licensee any rights to a contributor's trademarks
- recipients can combine licensed source code with other files under
  a different, even proprietary license
  * but the MPL-covered source files must be made freely available
- requirements
  * covered source code files must remain under the MPL, and distributors "may
    not attempt to alter or restrict recipients' rights" to it
  * it is either all or none of the code in a given source file falls under the
    license
  * licensee must ensure access to or provide all the source code within an
    executable
- users
  * Adobe Flex
  * LibreOffice
