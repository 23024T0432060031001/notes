# Writing well for the web

## Meet the user need

People do not usually read text unless they want information. When you write for
the web, start with the same question every time: what does the user want to
know? It means be

- specific,
- informative, and
- clear and to the point

## Finding information on the web

Requirements

- I can find the page with the answer easily
  - I can see it’s the right page from the search results listing
- after reading the page
  - I know what to do next
  - my fears are allayed, or
  - I do not need anything else

## Good content is easy to read

- short sentences
- sub-headed sections
- simple vocabulary

# Writing well for specialists

Government experts often say that because they are writing technical or complex
content for a specialist audience, they do not need to use plain English. This
is wrong.

Research shows that [higher literacy people prefer plain
English](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/02/17/guest-post-clarity-is-king-the-evidence-that-reveals-the-desperate-need-to-re-think-the-way-we-write/)
because it allows them to understand the information as quickly as possible.

People understand complex specialist language, but do not want to read it if
there is an alternative. This is because people with the highest literacy levels
and the greatest expertise tend to have the most to read.

## Technical terms

Where you need to use technical terms, you can. They are not jargon. You just
need to explain what they mean the first time you use them.

## Footnotes and legal language

Do not use footnotes on documents. They are designed for reference in print, not
web pages. Always consider the user need first. If the information in the
footnotes is important, include it in the body text. If it’s not, leave it out.

# Know your audience

- how they behave, what they are interested in or worried about - so your
  writing will catch their attention and answer their questions
- their vocabulary - so that you can use the same terms and phrases they’ll use
  to search for content

# How people read

## Common words

By age 9, you are building up your 'common words' vocabulary. Your primary set
is around 5,000 words; your secondary set is around 10,000 words. You use these
words every day.

## Use short words instead of long words

When you use a longer word (8 or 9 letters), users are more likely to skip
shorter words (3, 4 or 5 letters) that follow it. So if you use longer, more
complicated words, readers will skip more. Keep it simple.

- bad example
  - "The recently implemented categorical standardisation procedure on waste oil
    should not be applied before 1 January 2015."
- good example
  - "Do not use the new waste oil standards before 1 January 2015."

## Reading skills

Children quickly learn to read common words (the 5,000 words they use most).
They then stop reading these words and start recognising their shape. This
allows people to read much faster. Children already read like this by the time
they’re 9 years old.

People also do not read one word at a time. They bounce around - especially
online. They anticipate words and fill them in.

Your brain can drop up to 30% of the text and still understand. Your vocabulary
will grow but this reading skill stays with you as an adult. You do not need to
read every word to understand what is written.

## Explaining the unusual

If the context is right, you can read a short word faster than a single letter.
Thus, explaining the unusual words to explain the context would be very useful.

## Short sentences

People with some learning disabilities read letter for letter - they do not
bounce around like other users. They also cannot fully understand a sentence if
it is too long.

People with moderate learning disabilities can understand sentences of 5 to 8
words without difficulty. By using common words we can help all users understand
sentences of around 25 words.

## Capital letters are harder to read

As writers, we do not want people to read. We want people to recognise the
‘shape’ of the word and understand. It’s a lot faster.

Capital letters are reputed to be 13 to 18% harder for users to read. So we try
to avoid them.

Block capitals indicate shouting in common online usage.

## Ampersands can be hard to understand

The reason is that ‘and’ is easier to read and easier to skim.

## How users read web pages

Users read very differently online than on paper. They do not necessarily read
top to bottom or even from word to word.

Instead, [users only read about 20 to 28% of a web
page](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/). Where users
just want to complete their task as quickly as possible, they skim even more out
of impatience.

Web-user eye-tracking studies show that [people tend to 'read' a webpage in an
‘F’ shape pattern](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/).
They look across the top, then down the side, reading further across when they
find what they need.

What this means is: put the most important information first. So we talk a lot
about 'front-loading' subheadings, titles and bullet points.

For example, say 'Canteen menu', not 'What’s on the menu at the canteen today?'

# Titles

Most people who use GOV.UK start with a search engine. Use the same vocabulary
as your audience so they can find your content. This begins with your page title
and summary.

## Make your title unique

Titles on GOV.UK must be unique and informative so that users know which page
they are on.

## Check your title make sense

Your title should make sense:

- by itself – for example 'Regulations' does not say much, but 'Regulations for
  environmental waste' does
- in search results
- in [collections](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#document-collection)

Once you know the most popular keywords you can prioritise them in the title,
summary, introduction and subheadings

- good example
  - title
    - Bereavement Allowance (previously widow's pension)
  - summary
    - Bereavement Allowance (previously widow's pension) is a weekly benefit for
      widows, widowers or surviving civil partners - rates, eligibility, claim
      form.

## Keep your title short, where possible

Your title should be 65 characters or less (including spaces).

- reasons
  - Google cuts off the rest of the title at around 65 characters
  - longer titles are harder to understand

Make your titles clear and descriptive

- bad example
  - Hazardous waste - new process
- good example
  - How to dispose of hazardous waste in your area

## Avoid saying the same thing twice (tautologies)

- bad example
  - Using and submitting your business expenses
- good example
  - Submitting your business expenses

## Using 'ing' in titles

Use the active verb ('Submit') if you use the page to do the thing.

Good form title example: Submit your business expenses

Use the present participle ('Submitting') if the page is about doing the thing,
but you do it elsewhere.

Good guidance title example: Submitting your business expenses

## Do not include the format type in the title

- bad example
  - Consultation on furniture fire safety regulations
- good example
  - Amendments to furniture fire safety regulations
- bad example
  - Potato guidance
- good example
  - How to grow potatoes

## Remove the date unless it makes the title unique

# Summaries

Keep all summaries to 160 characters (including spaces) as Google usually only
shows the first 160 characters in search results. If your summary is longer,
make sure you cover the main point of the page in the first 160 characters.

Summaries should end with a full stop. It can help people who use assistive
technology like screen readers.

## Use plain English to avoid confusion

- write like you’re talking to your user one-on-one
- read the [words to avoid
  list](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#words-to-avoid)
- bad example
  - Implementing the government's strengthened approach to budget support:
    technical note
- good example
  - How the government is making budget support more effective in countries
    supported by the UK

## Avoid redundant introductory words

Do not repeat the content type in the summary - for example, do not say "this
consultation is about..." or "a form to...".

Use as few words from the title as possible, and include keywords that you have
not used in the title.

## Use active language

Keep summaries active and include a verb. You can use words like 'How...',
'What...' and 'When...' to introduce active words, for example 'When applying
for a...'.

# Structuring your content

## Page length

- remember that the pressure on the brain to understand increases for every 100
  words you put on a page
- It’s most important that you write well. If you write only a single paragraph
  but it’s full of caveats, jargon and things users do not need to know (but you
  want to say) then it is still too much.

## Writing body copy

Keep your body copy as focused as possible.

Remember that you’re likely to be battling outside factors for people’s
attention, not least their mood and situation. They might be looking on a mobile
on a train, trying to complete their task online in the middle of a stressful
family event or any combination of multiple unknowns.

- Do not repeat the summary in the first paragraph.
- Use the [inverted pyramid](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/)
  approach with the most important information at the top tapering down to
  lesser detail.
- Break up text with descriptive subheadings. The text should still make sense
  with the subheadings removed.
- Paragraphs should have no more than 5 sentences each.
- Includes keywords to boost natural search rankings.

## Headings

Do not skip heading levels, for example from H' to H4. Screen reader users may
navigate using a list of headings - a missed heading level can make this
confusing.

Do not use bold text instead of using subheadings. This is inaccessible because
a screen reader will not recognise it as a header.

You do not always need to have text between headings. Missing text between
headings is not a [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) fail, but sometimes
adding text between headings is helpful to provide context.

- do not use
  - questions - they're hard to front-load
  - technical terms unless you have already explained them
  - 'introduction' as your first section - users do not want an introduction,
    just give the most important information

## Do not use FAQs

If you write content by starting with user needs, you will not need to use FAQs.

FAQs are discouraged because they:

- duplicate other content on the site
- cannot be front-loaded
- are usually not frequently asked questions by the public, but important
  information dumped by the content editor
- mean that content is not where people expect to find it; it needs to be in
  context
- can add to search results with duplicate, competing text
